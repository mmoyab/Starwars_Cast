STAR WARS GAME SHOW CASTINGS

Suppose we’re working along with George Lucas’ team to select who will take part in each of the
shows of a new TV show called “Star Wars Game Show”.

Among other things, the system must allow casting managers to register prospective contestants
including their first name, last name, date of birth, mobile phone, country of residence, email and the
Star Wars character they will portray in the show. Managers should also be able to both modify the
contestants information and delete any of the contestants information. Please, bear in mind that all
the contestants should be at least 18 years old and reside in Spain.
The Star Wars characters to be assigned to the contestants upon creation can be loaded using SWAPI
(The Star Wars API - https://swapi.co ). Only the character name is required for this particular
assignment.

What we need is actually a website that casting managers can use as a database of all the
prospective contestant.
